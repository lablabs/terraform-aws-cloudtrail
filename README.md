## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| trail\_kms\_account\_ids | Specifies all account ids where organization trail will resides | `list(any)` | n/a | yes |
| attributes | Additional attributes (e.g. `1`) | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| bucket\_acl | The canned ACL to apply. We recommend log-delivery-write for compatibility with AWS services | `string` | `"log-delivery-write"` | no |
| bucket\_enable\_glacier\_transition | Glacier transition might just increase your bill. Set to false to disable lifecycle transitions to AWS Glacier. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| bucket\_enabled | Set to `false` to prevent the module from creating s3 bucket | `bool` | `false` | no |
| bucket\_expiration\_days | Number of days after which to expunge the objects | `number` | `90` | no |
| bucket\_force\_destroy | (Optional, Default:false ) A boolean that indicates all objects should be deleted from the bucket so that the bucket can be destroyed without error. These objects are not recoverable | `bool` | `false` | no |
| bucket\_glacier\_transition\_days | Number of days after which to move the data to the glacier storage tier | `number` | `60` | no |
| bucket\_kms\_master\_key\_arn | The AWS KMS master key ARN used for the SSE-KMS encryption. This can only be used when you set the value of sse\_algorithm as aws:kms. The default aws/s3 AWS KMS master key is used if this element is absent while the sse\_algorithm is aws:kms | `string` | `""` | no |
| bucket\_lifecycle\_prefix | Prefix filter. Used to manage object lifecycle events | `string` | `""` | no |
| bucket\_lifecycle\_rule\_enabled | Enable lifecycle events on this bucket | `bool` | `false` | no |
| bucket\_lifecycle\_tags | Tags filter. Used to manage object lifecycle events | `map(string)` | `{}` | no |
| bucket\_sse\_algorithm | The server-side encryption algorithm to use. Valid values are AES256 and aws:kms | `string` | `"AES256"` | no |
| bucket\_standard\_transition\_days | Number of days to persist in the standard storage tier before moving to the infrequent access tier | `number` | `30` | no |
| environment | Environment, e.g. 'prod', 'staging', 'dev', 'pre-prod', 'UAT' | `string` | `""` | no |
| name | Solution name, e.g. 'app' or 'jenkins' | `string` | `""` | no |
| namespace | Namespace, which could be your organization name or abbreviation, e.g. 'eg' or 'cp' | `string` | `""` | no |
| tags | Additional tags (e.g. `map('BusinessUnit','XYZ')` | `map(string)` | `{}` | no |
| trail\_bucket | Set bucket name for the Organization trail, meaningful only if bucket\_enabled is set to false | `string` | `""` | no |
| trail\_cloud\_watch\_logs\_group\_arn | Specifies a log group name using an Amazon Resource Name (ARN), that represents the log group to which CloudTrail logs will be delivered | `string` | `""` | no |
| trail\_cloud\_watch\_logs\_role\_arn | Specifies the role for the CloudWatch Logs endpoint to assume to write to a userâ€™s log group | `string` | `""` | no |
| trail\_enable\_log\_file\_validation | Specifies whether log file integrity validation is enabled. Creates signed digest for validated contents of logs | `bool` | `false` | no |
| trail\_enable\_logging | Enable logging for the trail | `bool` | `false` | no |
| trail\_enabled | Set to false to prevent the module from creating the Organization trail | `bool` | `true` | no |
| trail\_include\_global\_service\_events | Specifies whether the trail is publishing events from global services such as IAM to the log files | `bool` | `false` | no |
| trail\_is\_multi\_region\_trail | Specifies whether the trail is created in the current region or in all regions | `bool` | `false` | no |
| trail\_is\_organization\_trail | The trail is an AWS Organizations trail | `bool` | `false` | no |
| trail\_kms\_alias | The display name of the alias. The name must start with the word `alias` followed by a forward slash, leave default for auto generated alias | `string` | `""` | no |
| trail\_kms\_description | The description of the key as viewed in AWS console | `string` | `"KMS key to encrypt the logs delivered by CloudTrail"` | no |
| trail\_kms\_enable\_key\_rotation | Specifies whether key rotation is enabled | `bool` | `false` | no |
| trail\_kms\_enabled | Set to false to prevent the module from automatic KMS key creation | `bool` | `false` | no |
| trail\_kms\_key\_arn | Specifies the KMS key ARN to use to encrypt the logs delivered by CloudTrail, meaningful only if trail\_kms\_enabled is set to false | `string` | `""` | no |

## Outputs

## Contributing and reporting issues

Feel free to create an issue in this repository if you have questions, suggestions or feature requests.

### Validation, linters and pull-requests

We want to provide high quality code and modules. For this reason we are using
several [pre-commit hooks](.pre-commit-config.yaml) and
[GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/main.yml). A pull-request to the
master branch will trigger these validations and lints automatically. Please
check your code before you will create pull-requests. See
[pre-commit documentation](https://pre-commit.com/) and
[GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) for further
details.
